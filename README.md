BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) is a method used in statistics and genetics, especially in the context of animal and plant breeding. This method is used in both single-feature and multi-feature models. Below you will find a general description of the BLUP method in the context of both of these models:

BLUP Single Feature Model:
Purpose of the BLUP method:
BLUP is used to predict the genetic values ​​of individuals (animals, plants) based on phenotypic data (observed traits) and genetic information.
The main goal is to estimate the genetic value of the Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BV) for each individual.
How it works:
It uses genetic information from parents and offspring, as well as phenotypic data (e.g. breeding test results) to estimate genetic values.
The model is based on linear equations where genetic, environmental and other factors are incorporated into the equation.
What gives us:
It allows predicting the genetic value of offspring, which is important in animal and plant breeding in order to select for desirable traits.
It eliminates the burden resulting from environmental differences, which allows for a better comparison of the genetic value of individuals.
Usage:
Animal and Plant Breeding: Helps in selecting genotypes with desired characteristics, which speeds up the breeding process.
Genetics: Allows you to identify the influence of genes on specific traits.
BLUP Multi-Feature Model:
Extension to many features:
The BLUP multi-trait model simultaneously takes into account the influence of many features in the process of estimating genetic values.
Usage:
Used when we are interested in different traits at the same time, e.g. animal breeding, where there are several breeding traits.
Benefits:
It allows for the assessment of the influence of many features at the same time, which may be important in the case of multidirectional selection.
